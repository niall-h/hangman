# hangman
A game of hangman where the computer chooses a random word and you have to guess letters.

This is a project my friends and I did for our C++ Programming 2 class. The project is coded in C++ and the files are pretty self-explanatory. There are two
text files: "wordslist.txt" is the database of words that the computer will randomly choose from when starting the game, and "scoreslist.txt" stores the record
for each player. The code for the game utilizes maps, sets, vectors, file stream, and iterators.

Run on Visual Studio or any other C++ compiler capable of separate compilation
